        It’s a struggle to juggle people, projects, clients, deadlines, and
        expectations — especially when you’re the underdog competing against
        larger companies. We’re like you, we get it. That’s why we built
        Basecamp. In Basecamp, each project lives on a single page. With
        everything in reach, and every piece of information tracked and
        organized, everyone knows where to find what they need, and say what
        they need to say.
